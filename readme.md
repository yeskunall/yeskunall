#### Connect

Because of the nature of my work, I get to interact with a lot of people. In the past 5 years alone, I’ve talked to people from __6 continents__, and __over 90 countries__. Easiest way to reach me is via [email](mailto:hey@kimchiii.space). It doesn’t matter who you are, or your reason to contact me. Just do it. I __guarantee__ to get back to you.

#### Writing

I enjoy writing, and spend at least an hour daily writing. Here’s some worth reading:

- [Architecture from Code with Klotho](https://kimchiii.space/writing/meet-klotho)
- [Securing your Next.js site with security headers](https://kimchiii.space/writing/security-headers)
