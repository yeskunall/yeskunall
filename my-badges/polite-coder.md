I use words like "thanks" and "please" in my issues:

- <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/node-env-webpack-plugin/issues/1">#1</a>: Support for additional environments
- <a href="https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer/issues/32">#32</a>: How to use the given prompts?
- <a href="https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/issues/1022">#1022</a>: Clear URLs when copying/sharing a link
- <a href="https://github.com/weiran-zsd/dts-cli/issues/181">#181</a>: Auto-installation step should respect current package manager
- <a href="https://github.com/Thinkmill/keystatic/issues/1141">#1141</a>: Keystatic (Cloud) does not indicate it is not setup correctly

 And many more...
